# Edutainment

In the following section, replace `<Add app name>` with `edutainment` when you see it. 

## React Frontend Usage

Have NPM installed and add all dependencies.

```bash
npm install
npm audit fix
npm run build
```
## Quickstart

Start React App
```bash
npm start
```

Also add a .env file manually with the following line: 
```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

# Backend Python Overview

The backend runs on Flask, a web microframework, running on Python. API routes are defined under `server.py` and acts as a middleman to make calls to ChatGPT (or Claude) and return the payload to the frontend. In production, the application runs from a Docker container, but you can run the Flask server directly if you wish without Docker for development (read [Quickstart](#Quickstart)).

# Quickstart

First, set up your Python virtual environment, activate it, and install necessary packages.

```bash
python -m venv venv # setup venv
source venv/bin/activate # activate your virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # install necessary packages
```

You can spin up the backend server without Docker if you wish:

```bash
python server.py
```

Please note that this method may not mirror the production environment closely, and it's recommended to use Docker for a more accurate testing environment.

To run the ChatGPT conversation on the terminal, run:

```bash
python -m ask_your_podcasts.text
```

# Contributing

When adding new Python packages, please remember to update the requirements.txt file. This file is used by Docker to install necessary dependencies. To update the requirements.txt file, please run:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This command should be run from within the virtual environment to capture the correct list of packages.

# Docker

The benefit is that we all run on the same port locally and with the same dependencies. 

If you'd like to run Docker, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from here: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.

Important! To run locally, uncomment the bottom part of the Dockerfile and comment the middle section. Read the comments on that file. Then run the following commands 2 commands below. 

The only difference between PRD Docker commands and LOCAL is see the new backend changes fast. PRD configuration you have to stop each container created by docker, while LOCAL configuration you just have to clikc CTRL + C.

## Building the Docker Image

In order to run a Docker container, you must first build the Docker image for the application, navigate to the project root directory and run:

```bash
docker build -t <Add app name> .
```

This command will pull the Python base image, install all necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file, and set up the application which runs on a WSGI server setup by Gunicorn.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the Docker image has been built, you can start the container by running:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:80 <Add app name>
```

This command will start the Docker container and bind port 80 inside the container (where our application is running) to port 4000 on your machine. You can then access the application at http://localhost:4000.
